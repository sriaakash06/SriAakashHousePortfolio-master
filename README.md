### Welcome to my portfolio

Hi everyone, welcome to my portfolio.

I’m Sri Aakash, a B.Tech Information Technology student with a strong interest in UI/UX design and full-stack web development. I built this 3D portfolio alongside my academic studies to continuously improve my skills and to showcase my work in an interactive way.

About this project:
This portfolio is developed using React Three Fiber, with utility helpers from Drei. I used GSAP to create smooth camera animations, and the custom visual effects are written using GLSL shaders. The 3D house model was designed and rendered in Blender, then integrated into the web experience.

This project reflects my passion for creative coding, modern web technologies, and interactive user experiences.

If you notice any bugs, have suggestions, or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to hear your feedback.
