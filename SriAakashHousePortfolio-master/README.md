### Welcome to my portfolio

Hi everyone, thanks for being here.

I am a computer science student. I made this portfolio alongside my studies to increase my web development skills and show them.

Some details about this project.

I made this project with React Three Fiber. I used helpers from Drei. I used GSAP to animate the camera. The shaders are written with GLSL. I used Blender to create the house.

If you notice a bug or if you have any questions, please contact me.
